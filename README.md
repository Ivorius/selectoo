# Selectoo


- lazy (callback) item loading
- disabling a Selectoo input does not modify/reset its value, so it can be re-enabled without the loss of the information


Ui libraries
- [select2/select2](https://github.com/select2/select2)
- selectize/selectize.js
- harvesthq/chosen




Of course, you can build your own engines.
